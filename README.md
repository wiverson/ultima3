# Ultima III: Exodus, in the browser

**Play it:** <https://wiverson.github.io/ultima3/>

I played Ultima III as a kid on both my Apple //c and my Nintendo, and then
Ultima V on my Apple //gs. This is an updated version of LairWare's
Macintosh port of Ultima III, rewritten in TypeScript to run in a browser
and offline as an installable web app. It keeps the original keyboard
interface and many of the original skins: Apple II in colour and mono,
Commodore 64, NES, the PC's CGA, EGA, MCGA and VGA, the Ultima V look and
the Macintosh in black and white. I added a new theme, Standard, and kept
LairWare's own as an option.

Most modern players will prefer the new Controller mode, inspired by the
NES version. In Controller mode the whole game is played without a
keyboard, which suits a handheld or a phone and is far more accessible on
a desktop too. Its menus put the common actions at the top, and a few
shortcuts (cast the right heal, open a chest safely, light a dungeon) make
combat and exploration more fun than typing letters ever was. The cloth
map that came in the box can be viewed in the game, and a quest journal
gives just enough in-game hints that most players should finish without
an external guide. There are options that ease the difficulty a little.
The party shares one inventory for unequipped gear. And many, many other
improvements.

All of it is configurable in the game's Settings. If you want the original
gameplay, it is all still there: classic difficulty, keyboard commands,
the original skins. Not a single data file from the original LairWare
build has been touched; the port reads them as they are.

Ultima III is by Richard Garriott and Origin Systems (1983). The Macintosh
port is by Leon McNeill of LairWare, whose original README is at the
bottom of this page. This version is by Will Iverson.

## Playing

The game runs in any current browser. Chrome, Edge and Android offer to
install it from the address bar or the browser menu; on iOS use Share,
then Add to Home Screen. After the first visit it runs without a network.
Updates download in the background, and the title menu then offers
"Update: restart".

The game saves itself at every town, castle and dungeon door and at Quit,
in the browser's storage, and resumes on the next visit. The title menu's
Export game copies the saved game as text to the clipboard or a file, and
Import game reads it back, which is how a game moves between devices. On
iOS, add the game to the Home Screen: Safari and every other iOS browser
delete a site's storage after seven days without a visit, and the game
warns of this once a day in a browser tab.

### Controller mode

Chosen in Settings (Escape), or by pressing any gamepad button. A tap on a
touch screen shows a virtual controller, sized to an NES pad on any
screen.

    D-pad   move, or move the cursor in a menu
    A       open the command menu; choose
    B       cancel, or pass a turn
    X       ztats
    Y       look; attack in combat; ignite a torch in dungeons

On a keyboard the stand-ins are WASD or the arrows for the d-pad, Enter or
Z for A, Escape, X or B for B, C for X, V or Y for Y.

### Keyboard mode

The Apple II commands, one letter each:

    Arrows       walk; move in combat      Space   pass a turn
    Escape       settings                  J       journal
    #            view the cloth map

    A attack     B board      C cast      E enter     F fire
    G get chest  I ignite     L look      M modify    N negate
    O other      P peer gem   Q quit/save R ready     S steal
    T transact   U unlock     V volume    W wear      X exit craft
    Y yell       Z ztats

    Combat:   arrows move (into a monster attacks), A attack in a
              direction, C N R Z, Escape turns auto combat off
    Dungeons: up/down advance or retreat, left/right turn, I K D
              ignite, klimb, descend, L cycle the auto-map
    Shortcuts: ! cast the heal the party needs, @ safe chest, $ light

A "whom" prompt takes a member number, or Up and Down through the stats
boxes and Enter. The same controls are in the game under Settings > Help.

### Settings

Input mode, tile set, auto combat, poison kills, starvation, balanced XP,
the turn timer, sound effects, music and Help. Every setting is remembered
by the browser. A new game asks "Choose Thine Adventure!": Modern
(recommended), Classic (hardcore, the Apple II's rules) or Story
(relaxed), each a preset of the difficulty settings that can be changed
afterwards.

## What changed

### The Standard theme

Standard is LairWare's Macintosh tile set reworked into one consistent
look.

- Every figure is new flat pixel art: the eleven character classes, the
  townspeople, the eight monsters and their sixteen variants, the Exodus
  machine's four light states, the horse, the ships, the whirlpool, chest,
  moongate and shrine. The figures are drawn at 32 pixels on Apple II
  silhouettes, three tones per material, and doubled into the sheet, so
  they read as one family from the party grid to the combat arena.
- Each class has its own figure. Paladins, barbarians, druids, larks,
  illusionists, alchemists and rangers no longer borrow the fighter,
  cleric, wizard or jester. The party on the overworld is drawn as its
  members at half size in a 2x2 grid; in towns and castles the leader
  walks at full size with the others in a line behind, as on the NES.
- The Great Serpent that blocks the pass is one tall figure across two
  tiles, head to the south where the party comes to yell at it.
- The magic and fire balls of combat are flat orbs with the Apple II's
  diamond core, and a hit is a three-frame red burst rather than a HIT
  tile. The forcefield is bands of violet and blue that scroll without a
  seam.
- The frame, caps and cursor are recoloured from LairWare's teal to a
  darker copper that recedes behind the map. Moon phases are flat pixel
  moons in white and yellow. The fountain, mark rod, shrine and Time Lord
  scenes and the title logo are drawn in the theme's own style.
- Character boxes colour the name by state (green poisoned, grey dead,
  blue when Lord British would raise the member), and hit points go
  yellow under a quarter and red under a tenth.
- Repairs to the Mac sheet: seams in the scrolling water, lava and
  moongate tiles, alpha fringe on creature cells, and the Ranger, whose
  two frames were the same picture, gets a second frame with the sword arm
  raised. LairWare's own set is untouched, seams and still Ranger and all.

### Fidelity for the original skins

Changes that make each of the older tile sets look more like its machine
than the Mac version did.

- Each set paints its own first-person dungeon: wireframe corridors for the
  Apple II, Commodore 64 and Macintosh sets, blue and cyan for CGA, flat
  bricks in each palette for the NES and the EGA, MCGA, VGA and Ultima V
  sets. The Mac drew one photographic dungeon whatever the tiles; that
  pairing is the Lairware set.
- Each set has its own frame and cursor in its own palette; the five PC
  sets had borrowed the Mac's. Moon phases are shown as pictures in every
  set, flat pixel moons for the sets whose machines had them.
- The four full-window scenes and the title logo are drawn per set, in
  its style and palette; the Lairware set keeps the 3D renders.
- Exodus' lights run in every set. The Mac's cycling panels were kept
  in spare cells and copied about; the port draws them where they sit.
- Creature transparency is read from the sheet's own alpha; the Mac's
  separate mask files are honoured where a set ships one, and a set with
  neither draws creatures opaque, as its machine did.

### Controller mode

- The command menu lists what the surroundings call for first: Enter on a
  town, Board on a horse, Get on a chest, Attack beside a monster. Commands
  that make no sense where you stand are left out, and ones with nothing
  on hand (no gem, no torch, no caster alive) are greyed.
- In combat, a ranged weapon in hand puts "Attack (Bow)" first and a
  caster gets "Cast (spell)" with their last spell ready. Walking into a
  foe attacks it.
- Shortcuts cast at once, with no prompts, choosing the caster with the
  most mana: "Cast (Heal)" or "Cast (Great heal)" leads the menu when
  someone is hurt; "Cast (Safe chest)" sits under Get chest on a chest;
  "Cast (Long light)" or "Cast (Light)" sits under Ignite torch in a dark
  dungeon, the strongest light spell anyone can cast.
- Menus replace typed numbers on the title and party screens: the roster
  is a pick list, the party a list in marching order, attributes a screen
  where left and right spend the points, and a random name is offered.
  "Who?" prompts move a pair of arrows through the stats boxes.
- A virtual controller on touch screens, a gamepad through the Gamepad
  API, and an on-screen keyboard for names and words.

### Journal, map and hints

- A quest journal, which the Apple II never had. It reveals the main line
  one step at a time: speak to the king, the Mark of Kings, lost Ambrosia,
  the four cards, exotic arms, the Marks of Fire and Force, the silver
  snake, the order of the cards, Exodus. Each entry shows its progress and
  every clue heard about it, kept as the townsperson, king, prayer or Time
  Lord spoke it, with the town's name. Up and Down move between entries,
  and H (Y on a controller) prints a hint written for this port.
  "Journal updated" prints when something real changes.
- View map shows the cloth map of Sosaria from the box, through a CRT
  effect. Every moongate the party has come out of is marked on it with the
  moon that opens it, so the gate table writes itself one trip at a time.
- A dungeon auto-map, the graph paper of old: cells seen by torchlight are
  recorded, shown as a small overlay or as the whole level in place of the
  first-person view, which turns the dungeon into a top-down crawl.

### Party and inventory

- Gold and food are pooled for the whole party and shown on the top
  border. Members eat from the pool and go hungry together.
- Weapons and armour are pooled in one bag; a member's record keeps only
  what is readied and worn. Ready and Wear draw from the bag, so one sword
  cannot arm two members. Shops grey what the buyer's class cannot use and
  offer to ready or wear a purchase on the spot. Forming a party pools the
  bags; dispersing deals them out. The Hand command is gone.
- Gems, keys, powders and torches are the party's too, so Peer, Unlock,
  Negate time and Ignite never ask whose.
- Lord British's raise adds the hundred hit points as well as the room for
  them, and his prompt lists only the members due a level.

### Difficulty and settings

- Poison kills, off by default: poison stops at one hit point so a member
  limps home; on, it kills as on the Apple II.
- Starvation: Classic (the Apple II's, to the death), Mild (stops at half
  hit points, the default) or None.
- Timer: Fast (the Apple II's turn timer), Slow, or Off, which makes the
  game turn-based through and through.
- Balanced XP, on by default: a kill's experience is shared among the
  living members instead of going all to the killer.
- Auto combat, LairWare's addition, kept, with a smarter planner: members
  path round comrades and walls to the nearest square they can strike
  from.

### Play

- Bumping into things does what you would have typed next: a townsperson
  is talked to, a counter opens the shop, a locked door asks for a key, a
  monster is attacked.
- Transact asks the direction first and "who" only when it matters.
- Spell menus name spells by what they do (Magic bolt, Heal, Up a level),
  with the book name, cost and effect beneath.
- Other and Yell are one command, and EVOCARE works from either.
- Repeated turns fold together: "North (x5)" instead of five lines.
- Fountains and the Time Lord speak when the party steps onto them, not on
  every turn spent standing there.
- Direction and "who" prompts sit on the map's border so the map and the
  combat marker stay in view. The active member in combat has a fading
  outline instead of a blink.
- A party wipe offers a choice: try again from the last save, or flee to
  Lord British as the Apple II did.
- The game pauses, music included, while the window is not focused.
- Cheats, on the Help pages: full restore, raise every level, go home,
  exit dungeon, gold, food, gems, keys and torches. None of it existed in
  the original; it is there for testing and for anyone who wants it.

### Bug fixes

- Monsters far to the west of the party headed the long way round: the C
  port's heading test did not wrap as the Apple II's 8-bit arithmetic did.
- A new character could throw away their only dagger; now a dagger is
  thrown only when there is a spare.
- The Ranger stood still in the Mac set, its two animation frames being
  the same picture.
- Seams and fringe in the Mac tile sheet, described under the Standard
  theme.

### Left out on purpose

LairWare's Mac additions that were not part of the game: the animated
intro and attract mode, auto-heal, the modern stats dialog, the Diorama
map and random map generator, text-to-speech, mouse control and the Mac
dialogs. The Apple II text flow is used instead. Diagonal movement for the
party, which the Mac allowed, is off: as on the Apple II, monsters may
move diagonally and the party may not.

## For developers

The port is in [`web/`](web/README.md): how to run it, how the code is
organised, data formats and testing. The art briefs the new figures and
dungeon sheets were drawn to are in [`web/docs/`](web/docs/). The
original Macintosh sources and resources are at the root of the
repository, unchanged.

## License

# LairWare's Ultima III

This started out as an unofficial fan remake of the original 1983 Apple II game from Origin Systems.  Origin had made official Mac ports of a few older Ultima games, but these were all monochrome.  My remake was originally implemented in Think C for 1990s-era color Macintosh computers on Motorola processors running Mac OS 7.  I really liked how it was turning out, so I managed to get ahold of Richard Garriott over AOL and he liked it enough to give me permission to release it officially sometime in 1994 or 1995.

Some of the logic was originally gleaned through examining the Apple II version's 6502 assembly code.  You can find comments throughout the source referring to memory locations in this version!  There were no such things as "shrinkwrap" licenses back then which would forbid such reverse engineering.

In my spare time over the following 10+ years I would poke and prod at it to keep it running on current systems of the time; making it capable of running on Mac OS X without the need for Classic, compiling it for Intel processors to eliminate the need for Rosetta, adding support for alternate graphics, etc.  I had transitioned the project to CodeWarrior early on, then to Xcode when that came out.  By the time macOS Catalina was released with its removal of support for 32-bit executables, I had only barely touched this project for many many years.

For upload, I've mostly removed license key handling and update checking.  I haven't checked if it still compiles!  I keep telling myself that this isn't intended to be useful to anyone, it's just some code archaeology.

_Random fun fact: Ultima III was one of the first games to acknowledge non-binary gender!_

To put it another way: I'm not claiming any copyright on the Ultima franchise name, NPC names, the specific maps found in this game, etc.  This license just refers to everything else here.  I'm presenting it merely as historical code in good faith, in hope that no one will care to litigate -- there is indeed no feasible way I am aware of to build this project to run on a modern system without an emulator.
