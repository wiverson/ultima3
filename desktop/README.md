# Ultima III desktop app

A thin Electron shell around the built game in `../web`. See the developer
notes in `../web/README.md` for how it fits together, and the root README
for how to install the builds on Windows, macOS, Linux and the Steam Deck.

```sh
npm install
npm run bundle     # builds ../web with relative paths and copies dist/ into app/
npm start          # runs the app (add --fullscreen, --windowed, --new, --controller)
npm run smoke      # launches it, screenshots the running game, exits 0 on success
npm run dist       # installers for this platform into dist/ (dist:linux, dist:win, dist:mac)
```

Builds for all three platforms come from the "Desktop and Android builds"
workflow under Actions: a push to main that touches the game or an app
keeps them as artifacts, a manual run publishes them as a release. The
version comes from `version.cjs`: the major.minor of `version` in
`package.json` with the run number as the patch in Actions, or a
timestamped pre-release (`1.0.0-dev.20260915.2214`) for a build made
anywhere else; `BUILD_VERSION` overrides both. `npm run dist` passes it
to electron-builder as metadata, so `package.json` is never edited.
macOS builds are Apple Silicon only.
