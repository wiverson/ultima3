# Second pass: Pincher, Snatch, Griffon

Three figures from the first delivery to redraw. Everything else in the pack
is accepted and in the game. Rules, palette and delivery format are as in
`figure-art-spec.md`; only the drawing changes. `second-pass-reference.png`
shows the three as delivered, at 6x, at half size and on green, beside Bradle
and Dragon, which work.

## What is wrong

- **Pincher (tile 28)** has no pincers. It is a dome with two eyes and thin
  legs, and the name is the whole identity of the creature. Frame 2 only
  shifts the legs, so the "opens claws" action is missing. At half size it is
  a pale blob with dots.
- **Snatch (tile 90)** is the same dome in slate grey with red eyes. Colour
  is the only difference from the Pincher, so the variant reads as a palette
  swap, which the brief asked to avoid. Bradle, the other variant in the
  family, works because its brain lobes give it a shape of its own.
- **Griffon (tile 92)** reads as a goose: a bird's head on a bird's body,
  with the gold chest reading as a saddle. The brief said winged lion.

## Pincher (tile 28), two frames

- Keep the lilac dome and the two eyes.
- Add two large front claws, crab-like, one each side of the body, each
  claw 8 to 10 px long and 6 px tall at the pincer. The claws are the
  widest part of the figure and the first thing read at half size.
- Frame 1: claws open, the two halves of each pincer apart. Frame 2: claws
  shut, raised 2 px. Legs may shift with them.
- Colours: lilac light `#f5edfd`, base `#d7c0f9`, shade `#c2a9f3`. Eyes
  gold `#d9b65a`. Claw tips in the shade tone so they read against the dome.

## Snatch (tile 90), two frames

- Same family silhouette as the Pincher: dome plus front claws, so a player
  reads it as Pincher kind. Then make it its own creature in shape, not only
  in colour.
- Spiked shell: four to six 2 px spikes along the top of the dome.
- Longer, thinner claws than the Pincher, 12 px, with a hooked tip.
- Frame 1: claws forward. Frame 2: claws pulled in toward the body, as if
  snatching. Spikes do not move.
- Colours: slate light `#7c7c8a`, base `#5c5b65`, shade `#44434c`. Eyes red
  `#ae4551` with a `#e77b81` glint pixel. Spikes in the light tone.

## Griffon (tile 92), two frames

- A winged lion. The body, hind legs and tail are a lion's; the head and
  forelegs are an eagle's; the wings are the Dragon family's, so it keeps
  the family silhouette (see Dragon, tile 29, and Wyvern, tile 93).
- Side view like the Dragon, facing left. Four legs on the ground: two
  eagle forelegs with talons, two lion hind legs. Tail out behind with a
  tuft.
- Head: eagle, with a 2 px hooked beak and one eye. No neck feathers wider
  than the head, so it does not read as a bird again.
- Frame 1: wings up. Frame 2: wings down, tail up.
- Colours: body, hind legs and tail in gold `#d9b65a` with tan shade
  `#dca576` and light `#fdd7a9`. Head, wings and forelegs in bone light
  `#f2f2f1`, base `#d8d8d7`, shade `#a9a7a7`. Beak and talons gold
  `#d9b65a`. Eye `#141416`.
